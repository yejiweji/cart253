## Description
You stumble upon a strange field where you find a mysterious hole in the ground and a rock that shuffles the contents inside??!

THE GAMBLING HOLE, is a take on the classic slots machine found at casinos, although you're not gambling with money in this game, you're gambling with chance and ~destiny~! Land on all fishes and they'll make themselves at home (a little too much) in the hole, land on dinosaurs and they'll try to escape off the island, land on zombies and they'll try to take over your slots. How far will you go to gamble?!

*note-- the dinosaurs when it comes to draging them to the "island"/circle, drag and drop three times and it will move on to the next transistion; however, I tried repetedly but couldn't debug the dinosaurs to freeze/stop moving around once dragged to the island. So I would consider this project more of a prototype.

*note-- Also please take advantage of the probabilities of which symbols to display in the code, so that you're not having to repeatdly hit the spinning stone till it lands on all the same symbols.
