## Description

THE GAMBLING HOLE, is a take on the classic slots machine found at casinos, although you're not gambling with money in this game, you're gambling with chance and ~destiny~! Land on all fishes and they'll make themselves at home (a little too much) in the hole, land on dinosaurs and they'll try to escape off the island, land on zombies and they'll try to take over your slots. How far will you go to gamble?!
